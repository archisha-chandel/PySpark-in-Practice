    "## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* A branch of AI, where applications can automatically learn from data or experience is known as Machine Learning.\n",
    "* Traditional system needs explicit programming whereas a machine learning system derives logic from data.\n",
    "* Machine Learning applications can determine if a mail is spam, predict fraud, personalize entertainment.\n",

    "## 2. Supervised/Unsupervised Machine Learning \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Machine Learning applications can be trained with data-with-labels & also data-without-labels.\n",
    "* Meaning of data-with-labels : Feature Data (House Details like sqft, num_rooms, num_floors etc.), Target Data or labels (Price)\n",
    "* When a model learns using data-with-labels, it's supervised learning.\n",
    "* When model learns patterns from unlabeled data, it's unsupervised learning.\n",
    "* Examples of unsupervised learning : Grouping similar customer together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Types of Supervised Learning - Regression & Classification\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Regression - Target data is continues in nature:\n",
    "  - House Price prediction\n",
    "  - Rainfall prediction\n",
    "* Classification - target data is catagorical in nature:\n",
    "  - Predicting spam mail\n",
    "  - Predicting credit defaulter  \n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Ingestion\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Data gathering is one of the most important part of machine learning application development.\n",
    "* Without data there cannot be machine learning.\n",
    "* Data can be **batched** as well as streamed.\n",
    "* Batched data can be read by spark from csv, json, hive, databases etc.\n",
    "* Streamed data can be recieved from streaming servers like Kafka.\n",
    "* **Spark Streaming** can do processing on data received from Kafka.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data Wrangling\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Transformation of data to a more valuable format suited for downstream applications like Business Intelligence, Analytics etc.\n",
    "* It involves cleaning of data.\n",
    "* Removing incorrect data.\n",
    "* Aggregating information.\n",
    "* Python provides Pandas for Data Wrangling task. \n",
    "* PySpark provides **DataFrames** for data wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* PySpark provides Machine learning library for classification,regression,clustering etc.\n",
    "* Before data can be fed to machine learning libraries, it needs to be transformed to a format which is expected by machine leaning libraries.\n",
    "* Scaling techniques for bringing numerical data to same scale.\n",
    "* Encoding techniques for converting categorical data to numbers.\n",
    "* Text vectorization techniques.\n",
    "* ML algorithms only understands numbers.\n",
    "* Dimensionality reduction techniques for noise reduction from data & improving computation speed.\n",
    "* All preprocessor are present in **pyspark.ml.feature** module.\n",
    "* We have to create an instance of preprocessor & pass data to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Model Training\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* At this stage, data is ready for machine learning.\n",
    "* Based on the problem statement we might have to classification algorithm or regression algorithm.\n",
    "* Learning algorithms are part of **pyspark.ml.classification**, **pyspark.ml.regression** etc.\n",
    "* For supervised learning, pass feature data & target data.\n",
    "* For unsupervised learning, pass the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Model Validation & Selection\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* There are multiple models to be chosen from & multiple ways to configure models.\n",
    "* Model with perfect balance of bias & variance should be chosen.\n",
    "* For this we need to cross validate our model.\n",
    "* This step also includes hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
    "* Pyspark provides **pyspark.ml.tuning** for cross validation & hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Deployment\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Once the model is validated & selected, it needs to be deployed.\n",
    "* Persisting model for future reuse & shipping to customer.\n",
    "* Persisted model can be re-trained as well.\n",
    "* RESTful interface of model can be exposed for consumption."
