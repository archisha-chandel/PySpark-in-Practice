    "# Understanding PySpark Ecosystem\n",
    "#### Agenda\n",
    "* Why Machine Learning using PySpark ?\n",
    "* Big Data \n",
    "* Hadoop \n",
    "* Spark\n",
    "* PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Why Machine Learning using PySpark ?\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Traditional machine learning libraries like scikit don't scale more than a machine.\n",
    "* Using PySpark, we can achieve distributed machine learning without a lot change in APIs.\n",
    "* Dataframes in PySpark is distributed compared to dataframe in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Big Data\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Often defined by 4 V's:\n",
    "    * Volume \n",
    "    * Variety \n",
    "    * Velocity \n",
    "    * Veracity\n",
    "* Most of the organizations generate big data. \n",
    "* And, traditional systems are not capable of storing them or computing on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Hadoop\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Distributed storage & computing framework.\n",
    "* Consist of HDFS, MapReduce & YARN.\n",
    "* HDFS  can be understood as distributed storage framework.\n",
    "* YARN is distributed OS.\n",
    "* MapReduce can be understood as distributed application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Spark\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Is an open-source cluster-computing framework for teal time processing\n",
    "* Spark is an easy alternative to MapReduce.\n",
    "* MapReduce is difficult to write & manage.\n",
    "* Spark does in-memory computation & thus 10-50X faster than MapReduce.\n",
    "* Internally built using Scala.\n",
    "* Extremely difficult to develop machine learning applications on hadoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. PySpark\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* Many of data Processing & Machine Learning developers were using Python as their primary language.\n",
    "* Data volume & velocity changed. Traditional systems were not sufficient enough.\n",
    "* PySpark allows easy porting of code written in pandas & scikit to be ported to Spark for taking data to large scale processing.\n",
    "* SQL code can also be ported easily to PySpark.\n",
    "* PySpark was not stable with 1.X rel but very well adopted in 2.X rel across various companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Installation Guide\n",
    "* [Databricks](https://databricks.com/try-databricks) at community edition.\n",
    "* (OR) [Watson Studio Setup](https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/Watson-Studio-Setup)"
